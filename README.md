## Note

Editing the variable `STEP_INCREMENT` to equal 90 allows the mouse to draw a square instead of a circle. Even though a square is not a circle, the max score is still reached. The reason for this is explained in a [video by Code Bullet.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jv8nOKR_Ck&ab_channel=CodeBulletsDayOff)
